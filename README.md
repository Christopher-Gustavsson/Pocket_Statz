# Pocket Statz

A mobile-first application designed to provide a minimalist, streamlined approach to checking game statistics for professional sports teams. API calls provide live data as well as statistics from the most recent game, and users can either sign in for an unlimited experience or use the app as a guest to save up to three teams in their homepage list. Sign up and login forms use data validization.
